🔐 Detecting System Vulnerability to Malware Attacks Using ML Techniques

📌 Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning-based system that can analyze and detect system vulnerabilities which are prone to malware attacks. By leveraging data-driven approaches, it predicts which system configurations or behaviors are most susceptible to security breaches.

🧠 Motivation
Traditional signature-based malware detection methods struggle to identify zero-day attacks or unknown vulnerabilities. This project introduces a proactive approach using machine learning techniques to detect potential vulnerabilities before they are exploited.

🛠️ Features
📊 Data Preprocessing: Cleans and transforms raw system/malware logs.

🧪 Feature Engineering: Extracts relevant features that indicate system weakness.

🧠 ML Model Training: Trains various classifiers (Random Forest, SVM, KNN, etc.) to detect vulnerability patterns.

📈 Evaluation Metrics: Uses accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate performance.

🛡️ Prediction Module: Predicts system vulnerability risk level in real-time.

🧪 Methodology
Data Collection: Real or synthetic system logs and malware behavior datasets.

Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, normalizing.

Modeling: Evaluated various models for their ability to detect high-risk systems.

Validation: Cross-validation and test-set evaluation to ensure robustness.

📊 Experimental Results
Achieved up to 95% accuracy with Random Forest.

Feature importance shows critical indicators like unusual network calls, file permission changes, and registry modifications.

Demonstrated real-time inference capability on simulated inputs.
